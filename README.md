# AI-Powered Breast Cancer Diagnosis: A Deep Learning Approach for Early Detection

## **Executive Summary**  
As a **Data Scientist at MediScan Diagnostics**, a leading healthcare institution specializing in **early cancer detection and treatment**, my role is to leverage machine learning and deep learning technologies to enhance diagnostic accuracy. **Breast cancer remains one of the most common cancers worldwide**, and early detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment and survival. However, traditional diagnostic methods, such as manual mammogram analysis, are time-consuming and prone to human error, potentially leading to delayed or incorrect diagnoses.  

To address this challenge, **MediScan Diagnostics** is integrating **AI-driven predictive models** into its diagnostic workflow. This project aims to develop a **deep learning model** capable of accurately classifying breast tumors as either **malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous)** based on biopsy test results. The dataset consists of **historical biopsy records**, including **30 key diagnostic features** derived from medical imaging and laboratory tests.  

Our approach involves **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), class balancing using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), and deep learning model training** using **TensorFlow/Keras**. The model is trained to recognize subtle patterns in diagnostic features, allowing it to predict the likelihood of cancer with high accuracy. By integrating this AI-powered solution into MediScan Diagnostics’ workflow, **radiologists and oncologists can receive faster, more reliable assessments**, ultimately improving **early detection rates and patient outcomes**.  

This project demonstrates how **deep learning can transform medical diagnostics**, offering a scalable and reproducible solution for breast cancer detection. Moving forward, the model's performance can be enhanced through **further optimization, larger datasets, and real-world clinical validation**.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Before training our deep learning model, it is essential to analyze the dataset to identify patterns, detect class imbalances, and understand feature distributions. This process helps ensure that our model is trained on high-quality data.

### **Visualizing the Distribution of the Target Variable**

To understand the class distribution, we plot the number of **malignant (0)** and **benign (1)** cases.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Count the number of malignant (0) and benign (1) cases
sns.countplot(x=data_frame["label"], palette="coolwarm")
plt.title("Distribution of Benign and Malignant Cases")
plt.xlabel("Tumor Type (0 = Malignant, 1 = Benign)")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()
```

![Distribution of Benign and Malignant Cases](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0de0417f-76cf-441c-96ba-af6e1e7fa7e2)


**Observation:**  
The dataset is **imbalanced**, with **more benign cases than malignant ones**. This imbalance can cause the model to be biased toward the majority class, potentially leading to poor generalization for the minority class.

### **Handling Class Imbalance with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**

To address this imbalance, i applied **SMOTE** to oversample the minority class and create a balanced dataset.

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Splitting features and target variable
X = data_frame.drop(columns="label", axis=1)
Y = data_frame["label"]

# Apply SMOTE to balance the classes
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_resampled, Y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, Y)

# Visualizing the balanced class distribution
sns.countplot(x=Y_resampled, palette="coolwarm")
plt.title("Balanced Class Distribution After Applying SMOTE")
plt.xlabel("Tumor Type (0 = Malignant, 1 = Benign)")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()
```

**Observation:**  
After applying **SMOTE**, the number of malignant and benign cases is now equal, ensuring that our deep learning model is not biased toward the majority class.

## **Modeling**

### **Model Selection and Rationale**

To develop a robust **breast cancer classification model**, we chose a **deep learning approach** using a **Neural Network** implemented in **TensorFlow and Keras**. The key reasons for this choice include:

- **High Accuracy**: Neural networks are effective in capturing complex relationships within medical data.
- **Feature Importance**: Deep learning automatically learns patterns from the input features without manual feature engineering.
- **Scalability**: The model can be fine-tuned for higher performance with additional data.

### **Model Architecture**

The neural network consists of:

- **Input Layer**: Accepts 30 diagnostic features.
- **Hidden Layer**: A **Dense** layer with **20 neurons** and **ReLU activation** to capture feature interactions.
- **Output Layer**: A **Dense** layer with **2 neurons** and **sigmoid activation**, representing the probability of each class (0 = Malignant, 1 = Benign).

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

# Set random seed for reproducibility
tf.random.set_seed(3)

# Define the neural network model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(30,)),  # Input layer with 30 features
    keras.layers.Dense(20, activation="relu"),  # Hidden layer with ReLU activation
    keras.layers.Dense(2, activation="sigmoid")  # Output layer with 2 classes
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(
    optimizer="adam",
    loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy",
    metrics=["accuracy"]
)

# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train_std, Y_train, validation_split=0.1, epochs=10)
```

---

## **Model Evaluation**

### **Performance Metrics**

To assess the model’s performance, i used:

- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
- **Loss Function (Sparse Categorical Crossentropy)**: Evaluates how well the model’s predictions match the actual labels.
- **Validation Accuracy & Loss**: Helps prevent overfitting and ensures generalizability.

```python
# Evaluate the model on the test dataset
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test_std, Y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
```

### **Training vs Validation Loss**

To check for overfitting, i visualized the **training loss** and **validation loss** over epochs.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot training & validation loss
plt.plot(history.history["loss"], label="Training Loss")
plt.plot(history.history["val_loss"], label="Validation Loss")
plt.title("Model Loss Over Epochs")
plt.xlabel("Epochs")
plt.ylabel("Loss")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## **Results**

### **Predictions on New Data**

To test the model on real patient data, i used an example test case.

```python
# Example input data (30 diagnostic features)
input_data = (20.57,17.77,132.90,1326.0,0.08474,0.07864,0.0869,0.07017,0.1812,0.05667,
              0.5435,0.7339,3.398,74.08,0.005225,0.01308,0.0186,0.0134,0.01389,0.003532,
              24.99,23.41,158.8,1956.0,0.1238,0.1866,0.2416,0.186,0.275,0.08902)

# Convert to numpy array and reshape
input_data_as_numpy_array = np.asarray(input_data).reshape(1, -1)

# Standardize the input data
input_data_std = scaler.transform(input_data_as_numpy_array)

# Make prediction
prediction = model.predict(input_data_std)
prediction_label = np.argmax(prediction)

# Display result
if prediction_label == 0:
    print("The tumor is Malignant")
else:
    print("The tumor is Benign")
```
